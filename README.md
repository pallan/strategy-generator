# Strategy Generator

A curling strategy practice tool that generates randomized in-game scenarios on an HTML5 Canvas. Players and teams can use it to discuss strategy for different game situations.

## Features

- **Strategy Generator** (`index.html`) — Renders a curling house on canvas with randomly placed stones and a randomized game scenario (end, score, hammer, throwing position). Scenarios can be saved and loaded from browser localStorage.
- **Eligibility Calculator** (`eligibility.html`) — Age-based eligibility checker for curling events.

## Getting Started

This is a static site with no build step, no bundler, and no package manager. Open the HTML files directly in a browser or serve them with any static server (e.g., VS Code Live Server).
